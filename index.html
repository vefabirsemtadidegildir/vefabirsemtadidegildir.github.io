        <p class="second-paragraph">Landed in Dubai <em>around 7am in the morning,</em> went through immigration <strong>quickly</strong> (opposite to what I thought, as there were many immigration officers serving), then greeted by an Arabian Adventure assistant who gave us <br><ul><li>his contact and <li>all necessary information regarding hotel booking and Dubai.</ul></p><br>
         <h2>Day-2 (Aug 26)</h2>

         <p class="second-paragraph">I went straight to <strong>Mall of the Emirates.</strong> It was <ol><li>a nice, very beautiful mall, <li> but much smaller as compared to Dubai Mall.</ol></P>
